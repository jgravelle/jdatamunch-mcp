"""The Claude Code plugin manifest must stay in lockstep with pyproject.toml.

`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` pins the plugin version. Claude Code caches the
plugin against that string, so users receive updates ONLY when it changes.
A stale version here means every user stays on an old copy while PyPI moves,
which is the same failure server.json had for five months.

The MCP config is checked too: it names the PyPI package that `uvx` resolves,
so a rename in pyproject.toml without a matching edit here ships a plugin that
launches a package that no longer exists.

The config is declared INLINE in plugin.json rather than in a root `.mcp.json`.
A `.mcp.json` at a repository root is also read as project-scoped config, so
that file would offer a duplicate server to anyone opening this repo in Claude
Code. `test_no_root_mcp_json` holds that line.
